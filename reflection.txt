1. ca.myjava.query package
1.1 Using static SQL
	In this class I'm using static sql query to return data into a result set.
	And use a while loop to read the result set till the last line.
1.2 Using prepared statement
	In this class I'm using a prepared statement to query the data.
	The sql accepts 2 values as the life expectancy range and allow user to input the 
	value. Then read the value to a result set and print all the results.

2. ca.myjava.unknown package
	In this class I accept the user to input the whole sql statement and pass it as the 
	prepared statement. Then the statement is executed and showing the result based on 
	the query. If it's a select query, the program returns the data. Otherwise if it's update,
	insert or delete, only shows a message.

3. ca.myjava.update package
3.1 Using Prepared Statement to UPDATE 
	In this class I created a prepared statement with two parameters, allow user to input the 
	values to be updated. Then execute the statement.
3.2 Using Static SQL to DELETE
	In this class I simply created a statement and execute it with a delete statement.
3.3 Using Result Set to INSERT
	In this class I created a result set that returns all the data in the table. Then allow user to 
	input the data to be inserted. By calling the moveToInsertRow, updateString and updateInt methods,
	the new line could be inserted to database.
	* NOTE: I tried to perform INSERT and DELETE with result set in this class. Though I set the ResultSet 
	updatable, the program kept showing ORA-17076 indicating that the ResultSet is read-only. I assume 
	it's about the configuration of database. The SQLException prevents methods like deleteRow(), moveToInsertRow()
	to execute.
